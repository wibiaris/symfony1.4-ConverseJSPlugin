Add tests for your bugfix or feature

Add a test for any bug fixed or feature added. We use Jasmine
for testing. 

Take a look at ``tests.html`` and ``spec/MainSpec.js`` to see how
the tests are implemented.

Check that the tests run
------------------------

Check that the Jasmine BDD tests complete sucessfully. Open tests.html in your
